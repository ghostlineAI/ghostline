Let's now move onto the new project creation feature within the UX.

I expect you to:

1) Ensure that the webapp connects to the API for this feature
2) The API has the route setup
3) The service is created
4) All the variable names must match between the FE, BE, Database.  Further their data types must agree.
5) The feature works e2e
6) All unit, integration, e2e tests have been written
7) All unit, integration, e2e tests have passed

Be VERY careful about the coding here.  WE HAVE A WEBSITE that syncs up properly with our api.  Please follow what we've done (i.e. in syntax and generating new routes) in order to add this feature.

TO BEGIN, DO NOT DO ANY CODE WHATSOEVER.  JUST fill in your knowledge gaps and come up with a plan.  Before suggesting creating any new script - please do a thourough review to ensure that there isn't already a script doing what you want.
