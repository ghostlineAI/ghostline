# ADR-0003: Build Custom UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

Date: 2025-01-26
Status: Accepted
Deciders: GhostLine Development Team

---

## Context

GhostLine requires a modern, accessible, and AI-native user interface for its ghost-writing platform.
Based on our competitor UI audit, we need to decide between purchasing a pre-built template or building a custom solution.

### Requirements

- Support for complex multi-agent AI interactions
- Real-time collaboration features
- Responsive design across devices
- Professional, modern aesthetic
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance at scale
- Unique features for ghost-writing workflows

### Options Considered

1.  **Purchase Premium Template**
    -   Cost: $50-500 for quality templates
    -   Examples: Tailwind UI, Creative Tim, ThemeForest

2.  **Build Custom with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
    -   Cost: $0 (open source)
    -   Components are unstyled and can be tailored to our brand
    -   Full control over functionality and design

---

## Decision

We will **build a custom UI using Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui**.

This approach provides maximum flexibility to create a unique, AI-native user experience tailored to ghost-writing workflows,
which is a core competitive advantage. While initial development time is higher, the long-term benefits of a bespoke,
high-performance, and perfectly aligned UI outweigh the speed of using a generic template.

### Rationale

#### 1. **AI-Native Requirements**

- Agent-specific chat interfaces require custom components not found in templates.
- The UI must fluidly handle complex state changes from multi-agent interactions.

#### 2. **Technology Stack Alignment**

- Tailwind CSS integrates seamlessly with Next.js.
- shadcn/ui provides accessible, unstyled primitives that accelerate development without imposing design constraints.

#### 3. **Performance Benefits**

- Tailwind's utility-first approach with Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation produces highly optimized, small CSS bundles.
- We can ensure every component is built for performance from the ground up.

#### 4. **Flexibility and Control**

- Complete control over component design and behavior.
- No need to override or fight against existing template styles.
- Future-proofs the UI against limitations of third-party templates.

#### 5. **Developer Experience**

- Tailwind's utility classes speed up development once the initial learning curve is overcome.
- shadcn/ui's CLI makes it easy to add new, self-contained components.

#### 6. **Cost Effectiveness**

- No licensing fees.
- Eliminates the risk of purchasing a template that doesn't fully meet our complex needs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Complete design freedom for a unique brand identity.
- ✅ UI will be perfectly optimized for AI-native workflows.
- ✅ No reliance on third-party template updates or support.
- ✅ High performance and accessibility from the start.

### Negative

- ❌ Higher initial development effort compared to using a template.
- ❌ Requires strong front-end expertise to build from scratch.
- ❌ Longer time-to-market for the initial version.

### Mitigation Strategies

1.  Use shadcn/ui's pre-built components as a foundation to accelerate development.
2.  Focus on core features first, and iterate on the UI in subsequent phases.
3.  Allocate dedicated front-end resources to the project.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- Set up Tailwind CSS configuration.
- Define a design system (colors, typography, spacing).
- Add core shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card).

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2)

- Build editor interface with Tiptap.
- Create chat components for agent interaction.
- Develop the main application layout.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)

- Visual project management tools (kanban, timeline).
- Real-time collaboration features.
- Finalize all UI/UX details.
