## Synthesis & Recommendations for GhostLine

Based on this audit, GhostLine should aim to combine the **organizational power of Scrivener**, the **modern UI/UX of Atticus**,
and the **workflow-integrated AI of Sudowrite**.

### Recommended UI Approach:

- **Adopt a three-panel layout**:
  1.  **Binder/Navigator** (Left): For chapters, notes, and source materials.
  2.  **Editor** (Center): A clean, distraction-free writing space powered by Tiptap.
  3.  **AI/Inspector** (Right): A contextual panel for agent interaction, metadata, and version history.

- **Prioritize a PWA architecture** for cross-platform compatibility from day one.

- **Integrate AI tools non-intrusively**. Use a sidebar for AI suggestions and controls rather than disruptive pop-ups.

- **Develop a strong "Voice" feature**, learning from Jasper AI, to ensure all generated content matches the author's style.

- **Implement real-time collaboration**, similar to Reedsy and Google Docs, as a core feature.

This hybrid approach will allow GhostLine to differentiate itself by offering a uniquely powerful, modern, and AI-native solution
that addresses the key pain points of existing tools.
