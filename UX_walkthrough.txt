# GhostLine — Comprehensive UX Summary

GhostLine is a full-stack AI book-writing platform that simulates the experience of working with a human ghostwriter. It allows users to upload raw content—text, documents, audio recordings, images, and notes—into project-specific data rooms, and from there, iteratively generate a publishable book that reflects their voice, style, and intent. The goal is to enable anyone—regardless of writing skill—to create a high-quality, long-form narrative that is emotionally resonant, stylistically aligned, and narratively compelling.

The app includes a left-hand nav with **Projects**, **Data**, **Create**, **Billing**, and **Account**. Every project contains its own data room (a repository of source material like PDFs, images, audio files, and rich text notes) and is linked to its own creative workspace. Users can drag and drop assets, record voice notes directly, or type in content, and everything is processed automatically (transcribed, OCR'd, embedded).

Once data is uploaded, the user goes into the **Create** tab, which is scoped to the same project. Here, they input a prompt like *"Write an 80-page humorous autobiography based on this material."* Behind the scenes, GhostLine orchestrates multiple AI agents: one plans an outline, another drafts chapters, another evaluates style similarity, and yet another enforces narrative cohesion. Crucially, the system doesn't dump the full manuscript—it generates in manageable sections (chapters, scenes, chunks) and asks for user feedback mid-process. Every chapter is reviewed, revised, and approved before proceeding.

Tone-matching and consistency are core to GhostLine. The system compares every draft to a style fingerprint generated from the user's own voice memos or writing. Users get real-time feedback on how close each section is to their tone. After drafting, GhostLine runs a QA pipeline: checking names, timelines, voice drift, and potential hallucinations. Issues are flagged for manual review.

Once a manuscript is approved, GhostLine allows export in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, EPUB). Each version is stored, versioned, and downloadable via a secure portal. Billing is token-based—Basic, Premium, and Pro tiers each include a monthly quota, and users can top up at any time. Token usage appears clearly in a Billing dashboard.

All updates—uploads, outline completions, chapter approvals, QA results, billing alerts—are sent via WebSocket push and email, and stored in a Notification inbox. Users can also fork their project to create "Second Editions" or restart from earlier checkpoints.

Finally, GhostLine is fully production-grade: every deploy syncs through GitHub Actions → S3 → CloudFront with invalidation, backed by AWS Route 53 + ACM. Environments are cleanly separated (`dev.ghostline.ai`, staging, prod). Backups, monitoring, autoscaling, and security guardrails are built in.

GhostLine isn’t just a tool for writing. It’s a production pipeline for authorship that lets real people make real books—with LLMs doing the heavy lifting, and humans staying in the loop where it counts.

## Implementation Guidance for LLM-Based System

The following sections describe the intended user flows and major UX components. These are written to guide AI systems toward autonomous implementation without prescriptive technology decisions. LLMs should interpret the desired outcomes, make implementation choices, and reason about trade-offs where applicable.

### 1. User Sign-Up and Authentication

* Landing page features CTA for account creation.
* Auth flow should support trusted SSO.
* On login, create user profile with plan and token allocation.
* User receives a welcome email and onboarding walkthrough.

### 2. Project Creation and Setup

* Users create distinct projects that organize all writing activity.
* Each project includes metadata (name, type, optional description).
* Users are redirected into a scoped working environment.

### 3. Data Room Functionality

* Users upload source materials: audio, documents, notes, and images.
* Users can also create notes or record voice memos inside the app.
* Uploaded assets are automatically processed for later retrieval (e.g., embedding, transcription).

### 4. Prompt-Based Story Initiation

* Users enter a book generation prompt describing tone, goal, format, length, etc.
* The system should create a narrative plan and propose a chapter outline.

### 5. Iterative Drafting Process

* Generation proceeds one section at a time.
* User feedback is requested after each draft.
* Users can accept or provide instructions for revision.

### 6. Voice Matching and Quality Control

* The system derives a user style fingerprint from uploaded or authored text.
* Generated drafts are evaluated against this style.
* Quality checks ensure continuity, accuracy, and stylistic alignment.

### 7. Export Options

* Finalized manuscripts should be exportable in formats such as PDF, DOCX, and EPUB.
* Outputs should be versioned and downloadable through the UI.

### 8. Subscription and Token Billing

* Plans include token-based limits for generation and processing.
* A usage dashboard tracks spending and allows plan upgrades.
* Billing flows should be transparent and event-driven.

### 9. Real-Time Feedback and Notifications

* System events trigger in-app notifications and/or email updates.
* A unified notification panel displays all relevant status changes.

### 10. Project State & History Management

* All project actions are recorded in an activity timeline.
* Projects can be forked or restored from previous states.

### 11. Operational & Deployment Infrastructure

* CI/CD pipelines should support seamless builds and deployments.
* Multi-environment setup ensures testing and staging.
* System should include observability, backups, autoscaling, and basic red teaming.

LLMs tasked with implementation should use this document to infer architecture, flow design, orchestration logic, and performance priorities in alignment with GhostLine’s goal: to give users a world-class creative writing partner driven by automation, clarity, and voice fidelity.
